# Alterant

Alterant is a configuration transformer. It reads and converts configuration files in YAML using Javascript you write. The purpose of Alterant is to provide a transparent and auditable way to apply changes to configuration files, like Kubernetes manifest files.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This branch of the Alterant repository is based on the old (v1) Ruby based code. The new Alterant is written in Go and can be found under the `master` branch.

The Ruby code is now retired and will not be maintained.
